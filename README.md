# AI-Algorithm-Visualisation

A Search Algorithm Visualization tool created as a part of my miniproject.

Following Algorithms are available in this tool (subjected to change/added)
* Non-Heuristics Based Algorithms
    * Depth First Search
    * Breadth First Search
* Heuristcs Based Algorithms
    * Hill Climbing
    * Beam Search
    * Branch and Bound
    * Branch and Bound + Heuristics
    * A Star

### Methodology
* HTML, CSS-Bootstrap are used for webpage layout _(Work Pending)_. 
* To carry out event handling, [brython](https://www.brython.info/) - A Transcompiler from python code to javascript is used (Pretty good though).

### Usage

* Watch this short Youtube video ([Working on]()) to find out how to use it.
